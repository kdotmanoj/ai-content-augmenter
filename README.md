## How It Works

This application leverages the power of Cloudflare's developer platform to create an intelligent layer on top of the existing web.

The entire process happens in milliseconds:
1.  A user requests a webpage through the Worker's URL.
2.  The Cloudflare Worker intercepts the request.
3.  It fetches the original page content and extracts the clean text using `HTMLRewriter`.
4.  The text is sent to two different **Workers AI** models in parallel:
    * **`@cf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1`** generates the summary.
    * **`@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8`** generates the SEO keywords.
5.  The Worker uses `HTMLRewriter` again to stream the original page back to the user, seamlessly injecting the AI-generated summary and keywords.
